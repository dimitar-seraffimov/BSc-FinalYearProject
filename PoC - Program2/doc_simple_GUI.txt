Documentation for the GUI - Proof of Concept Program 2 

The second Proof of Concept (PoC) program is focused on developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will be used for the final implementation of the project.
The ambitious goal for the final project is to have a mobile application, a "Sudoku" game.

My idea for the design and user interface is to keep it minimalistic, with a dark theme and a simple layout. 
The user can choose between a few different additional themes, and the application will remember the user's choice for the next time they open the application.
The user will be able to choose between a few different difficulty levels, and the application will generate a new Sudoku puzzle for the user to solve.

The user interface will be written entirely in React Native, and the application will be tested on Android devices.

The application will consist of the following screens and corresponding components:
- #Home screen
  - slide bar to choose different difficulty levels -> DONE
  - button to choose different theme
  - button to start a new game -> DONE
  - button to continue from previous game 
  - button to view the history of games, redirect to #History -> DONE

- #Game screen
  - the Sudoku puzzle - grid of 9x9 cells and 1-9 numbers displayed as buttons under the grid -> DONE
  - button to validate the solution
  - button to clear the selected cell -> DONE
  - button to clear the entire grid 
  - button to return to #Home screen -> DONE

- #History screen
  - list of all previous attempts
    - displayed as a button with the date and time of the attempt
    - when clicked, the button will redirect to #Solved screen with the solved attempt loaded
  - button to return to #Home screen -> DONE

  - #Solved screen
    - displays the solved Sudoku puzzle
    - button to return to #History screen  

- #About screen
  - displays information about the application
  - button to return to #Home screen

- #Instructions screen
  - displays instructions on how to solve a Sudoku game and how to unteract with the application
  - button to return to #Home screen
